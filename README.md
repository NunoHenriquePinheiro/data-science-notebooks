# data-science-notebooks
Jupyter notebooks with Python challenges.
This repo is now mainly driven by the challenges in the [Postgraduation in Data Science](https://www.rumos.pt/curso/pos-graduacao-em-data-science-pgds-presencial-com-live-training/) that I am currently attending.

## Projects:

- Data Collection Methods - Collecting Portuguese Airports data:
  - Collect data on Portuguese Airports resorting on web scraping and API endpoints
  - Work on information with Pandas DataFrames
  - Export information in JSON files
  - Persist data in SQLite database (one only table)
  
- Pre-Processing Methods - Predicting House Sales' price boundary:
  - Improve the prediction of a Sale Price boundary in house sales, using feature engineering across 6 iterations to improve the algorithm
  - Use different strategies to handle data features, in order to increase their utility for the given task: handling/encoding missing value, encoding categorical data, feature scaling and feature selection.
