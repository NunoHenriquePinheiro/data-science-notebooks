# data-science-notebooks
Jupyter notebooks with Python challenges.
This repo is now mainly driven by the challenges in the [Postgraduate studies in Data Science](https://www.rumos.pt/curso/pos-graduacao-em-data-science-pgds-presencial-com-live-training/) that I am currently attending.

## Projects:
